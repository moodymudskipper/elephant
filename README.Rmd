> Elephants never forget!

*elephant* is a quick experiment on how to make variables remember their
history. 

Use `:=` to record a call.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/elephant")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(elephant)
## basic example code
```

We build an elephant object by using `:=`

```{r}
x := 1
y := 3
z := x + y
x := x * 2
bar <- x + y + z
foo := x + sqrt(z) + bar

x
y
z
bar
foo
```

Here we see `bar` is not an elephant object because it doesn't use `:=` and 
`+.elephant` doesn't preserve class and attributes.

However `baz <- x` would just copy the object, so in this case it's advised to do
either `baz := x` or `baz <- forget(x)`

```{r}
# not good
baz <- x
baz

# good
baz := x
baz

# good
baz <- forget(x)
baz
```
