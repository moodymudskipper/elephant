> Elephants never forget!

*elephant* is a quick experiment on how to make variables remember their
history. 

Use `:=` to record a call.

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/elephant")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(elephant)
```

We build an elephant object by using `:=`

```{r}
x := 1
y := 3
z := x + y
x := x * 2
bar <- x + y + z
foo := x + sqrt(z) + bar

x
y
z
bar
foo
```

Here we see `bar` is not an elephant object because it doesn't use `:=` and 
`+.elephant` doesn't preserve class and attributes.

However `baz <- x` would just copy the object, so in this case it's advised to do
either `baz := x` or `baz <- forget(x)`

```{r}
# not good
baz <- x
baz

# good
baz := x
baz

# good
baz <- forget(x)
baz
```

We can access the variables used to compute our elephant object by using 
`list_calves()` or `calf()`.

```{r}
list_calves(foo)
list_calves(foo, "z")
calf(foo, "z")
calf(foo, "z", "x")
```

## Debugging with *elephant*

If an elephant calls fails, its memory is preserved and can be recovered using
`poach()`, see the example below :

```{r, error = TRUE}

test <- function(){
  x := 1
  y := 3
  z := x * 2
  bar <- x + y + z
  foo := x + sqrt(z) + bar * "a" # <- problematic call!
}

test()

poach()

# extract the bar variable as used by foo, for further investigation
foo_poached <- poach()
bar <- calf(foo_poached, "bar")
bar

# we can go deeper
calf(foo_poached, "z", "x")
```

## Benchmark

`:=` has a small overhead, it shouldn't slow your code much most of the time:

```{r}
bench::mark(
  elephant_assignment = (foo := x + sqrt(z) + bar), 
  standard_assignment = (foo <- x + sqrt(z) + bar), 
  check = FALSE)
```

However it wouldn't not be well advised, nor really that useful, to use it in
a loop growing an object as below.

```{r}
x := 1
for (i in 1:4) {
  x:= x + 1
}
x
```

It's especially true for bigger objects as we'd be keeping in memory all previous values
that would have been flushed by the garbage collector if we hadn't used *elephant*.
